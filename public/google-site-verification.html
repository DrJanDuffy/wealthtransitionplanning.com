Google Search Console Verification File

If you choose the HTML file upload method in Google Search Console:
1. Download the verification file Google provides
2. Replace this file with that content
3. OR use the meta tag method (recommended) - see layout.tsx

The meta tag method is already configured in app/layout.tsx
Just add NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION to your .env.local file

# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Immediate Solution

## Your deployment isn't auto-triggering. Here's the fastest fix:

---

## ⚡ QUICK FIX (30 Seconds)

### Go to Vercel Dashboard and Manually Deploy:

1. **Visit:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click** your project: `wealthtransitionplanning.com`
3. **Click** "Deployments" tab
4. **Click** "Deploy" button (top right, blue button)
5. **Select:** "Deploy Latest Commit"
6. **Select branch:** `main`
7. **Click** "Deploy"

**That's it! Your site will deploy immediately.** ✅

---

## Why This Happens

Vercel's auto-deploy sometimes doesn't detect GitHub pushes if:
- Webhook isn't configured
- Repository connection needs refresh
- GitHub webhook delivery failed

**Manual deployment always works!**

---

## After Manual Deployment

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for build
2. **Check status** - should show "Ready"
3. **Visit site:** https://www.wealthtransitionplanning.com
4. **Verify** it's working

---

## If Manual Deploy Doesn't Work

### Check These:

1. **Vercel Settings → Git**
   - Is repository connected?
   - Is production branch `main`?

2. **Build Logs**
   - Any errors?
   - Check deployment logs

3. **GitHub Repository**
   - Are commits on GitHub?
   - Visit: https://github.com/DrJanDuffy/wealthtransitionplanning.com/commits

---

## Permanent Fix (Optional)

After manual deploy works:

1. **Vercel → Settings → Git**
2. **Disconnect** repository
3. **Reconnect** repository
4. This recreates the webhook
5. Future pushes should auto-deploy

---

## ✅ Success!

Once you manually deploy, your site will be live at:
**https://www.wealthtransitionplanning.com**

**Then you can complete the Google setup steps!** 🎉

---

**TL;DR:** Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click "Deploy" → Select "Deploy Latest Commit" → Deploy!

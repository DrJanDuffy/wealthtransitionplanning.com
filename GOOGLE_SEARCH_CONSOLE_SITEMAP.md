## Verify Sitemap is Accessible

Before submitting, verify your sitemap is accessible:

- **Robots.txt**: Your robots.txt already references the sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`
- **Change Frequency**: 
  - Homepage: Weekly
  - Blog: Weekly
  - Other pages: Monthly
- **Last Modified**: Automatically set to current date

## Troubleshooting

### If Sitemap Shows Errors:
1. **404 Error**: Make sure the site is deployed and accessible
2. **Empty Sitemap**: Check that pages are being generated correctly
3. **Wrong Domain**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly in Vercel

### Check Sitemap Status:
- Go to Google Search Console → Sitemaps
- Click on your sitemap to see details
- Check for any warnings or errors

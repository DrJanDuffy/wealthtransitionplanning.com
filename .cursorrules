# Cursor AI Rules for Wealth Transition Planning Website

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 13+ website for Wealth Transition Planning - a luxury real estate service for financial planners in Las Vegas, Nevada.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4.0
- React

## Design Principles
- **Luxury Home Design**: Premium, elegant aesthetic for high-end real estate services
- **WCAG AA+ Accessibility**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text
- **Professional Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy

## Color & Contrast Standards
- Primary text: `text-gray-900` (#111827) on light backgrounds
- Secondary text: `text-gray-700` (#374151) minimum for body text
- Dark mode: `text-gray-100` (#f3f4f6) on dark backgrounds
- Links: `text-blue-600` with `hover:text-blue-700`
- Buttons: White text on `bg-blue-600` backgrounds

## Code Conventions
- Use `text-gray-900` for all primary text content
- Use `text-gray-800` or darker for text on colored backgrounds (blue-50, neutral-50)
- Always include dark mode variants: `dark:text-gray-100`, `dark:bg-gray-900`
- Prefer semantic HTML elements
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes

## File Structure
- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/app/components` - Reusable React components
- `/app/config` - Configuration files (business info, services)
- `/app/global.css` - Global styles and contrast rules

## Key Components
- `ServiceTierCard` - Service pricing cards
- `FinancialCheckupCTA` - Call-to-action sections
- `TestimonialCards` - Client testimonials
- `FAQAccordion` - Expandable FAQ sections
- `ProcessTimeline` - Step-by-step process display

## Best Practices
1. Always ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds
2. Test all changes in both light and dark modes
3. Keep accessibility as a priority
4. Maintain consistent styling across all pages
5. Use the established color palette from global.css
